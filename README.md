# Piano platformer
## Introduction
Piano platformer is a 2D platformer shooter. It focusses on having a lot of different spells which you can combine by inputting them at the same time.
## How to play
The game revolves around the player's weapon, a portable piano where each note corresponds to a spell, such as a fireball. The key feature is that spells can be combined by pressing multiple keys simultaneously, allowing for unique spell combinations. In addition to casting spells, the player can move, jump, and dash, with the dash mechanic being combinable with spells for various movement options. This creates a dynamic combat and traversal system where strategy and quick reflexes are essential to mastering spell combinations and movement.
